Bootshine has a potency of 210, or 310 when you have Leaden Fist. When in Opo-Opo form, Bootshine will always crit. Dragon Kick has a potency of 320. When in Opo-Opo form, it will grant the Leaden Fist buff. True Strike has a potency of 300.</description></item><item><title>Monk Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 10:21:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/basic-guide/</guid><description>A Monk Guide by Perfect Balance Prelude Preamble Well, we&amp;rsquo;re finally here. More than eight years in the making, and Intern-kun has finally decided that enough is enough; he&amp;rsquo;s going to intentionally change Monk gameplay in the 6.0 expansion. It&amp;rsquo;s been a long road &amp;ndash; from a series of accidents birthing TK gameplay, to Anatman encouraging Monks everywhere to equip their Fisher job stones &amp;ndash; but this is the expansion where, in theory, the rotational changes are going to be calculated, deliberate, and above all hold no emergent gameplay value resulting from a severe lack of foresight and/or understanding of how the game works&amp;hellip;.</description></item><item><title>Monk Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 21:07:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Oops, we don&amp;rsquo;t have that guide yet!

As purely the best option, yup, go back to 1:1 Twin Snakes and True.
What&amp;rsquo;s with the double Dragon Kick in the openers?
With Standard, you DK after Perfect Balance for DK&amp;rsquo;s higher potency and again later to gain Leaden finally. With Early Buff a stanceless Leaden Boot after PB is worse on average than using the DK to guarantee a crit one.</description></item><item><title>Monk Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/openers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 03:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/openers/</guid><description>Openers Lunar Solar Double Solar Early Lunar Solar Early Double Solar Rotation Looping rotation - French translation - Korean translation -</description></item></channel></rss>
