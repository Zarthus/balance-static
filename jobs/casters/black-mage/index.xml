Use the &amp;ldquo;Speed 3655 SpS&amp;rdquo; Tier set for BLM, and use SMN/RDM BiS on the other casters. Shared pieces between the sets have no meld conflicts.

A: Purely a downtime tool, a better version of Transpose. Lets you build back up to Umbral Ice III + Three Umbral Hearts during downtime, so you can Thunder III -&amp;gt; Fire III when you can hit something again. If you end a fight in Astral Fire, Transpose into UI so you can use Umbral Soul. Do not use Umbral Soul during uptime.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/openers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 01:51:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/openers/</guid><description>Openers Openers should put abilities on cooldown, fit strong spells within buff windows, and minimize clipping. All openers assume there is a pull countdown and the boss is pulled at zero. If your group pulls earlier, adjust them as necessary.

With all openers being very close in estimated output over the course of the entire encounter, it is instead recommended to choose your opener based on your current spellspeed, with consideration towards potential fight-specific requirements.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 01:49:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/skills-overview/</guid><description>PvE actions Icon Action Level Type MP Casting Recast Description Blizzard 1 Spell 400 2.5s 2.5s Deals ice damage with a potency of 180.

BLM has no bad substats.
Infinite resources and lack of damaging oGCDs makes Spell Speed a strong stat. More SpS can make the job feel smoother to play and make Fire Phases less strict. Aim for higher iLvl gear and get SpS to personal preference and comfort level.</description></item></channel></rss>
