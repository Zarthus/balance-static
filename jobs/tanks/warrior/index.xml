UCoB / UWU / TEA ? Sets are currently being gathered in one doc: http://bit.ly/WARultimateBIS
Many pieces of gear are BiS when synced down.
The &amp;lsquo;low&amp;rsquo; stat on the higher ilvl gear will reach the stat cap on the lower ilvl gear.
This outweighs the melds you lose in some cases, and in others it is few points of stats behind.
UCoB: ilvl 418 and above will have both stats capped UWU: ilvl 470 and above will have both stats capped TEA: No available ilvl cap yet, syncing gear will not cap all substats and will ignore melding slots.</description></item><item><title>How to Fell Cleave - An Angry Wannabe-Healer, also known as Warrior 5.0 - The Guide</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/how-to-fell-cleave-an-angry-wannabe-healer-also-known-as-warrior-5-0-the-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/how-to-fell-cleave-an-angry-wannabe-healer-also-known-as-warrior-5-0-the-guide/</guid><description>How to Fell Cleave &amp;ldquo;An Angry Wannabe-Healer Guide&amp;rdquo; Warrior Primer v5.3 (last update 2021-08-14)
