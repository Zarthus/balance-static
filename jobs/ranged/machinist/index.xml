You can use Hypercharge freely when above 50 heat as long as four conditions are met:
Drill and Air Anchor have more than eight to ten seconds left on cooldown You will not break your combo. (It will break if you try to carry it over HC + Drill + Anchor.) You have 0-1 Gauss Round and Ricochet charges stored.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/openers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 22:03:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/openers/</guid><description>Openers Listed below are all current openers and the reasoning as to why each one should be selected.

By Dook (Dook#0001)
Special thanks to Lynn Nuvestrahl, Sune Dakwhil, Chione Frost and Hinoka Shirasagi for helping me write this. It’d be somewhat elementary without them.

The encounter is split into four phases: Living Liquid, Brute Justice/Cruise Chaser, Alexander Prime, and Perfect Alexander. The fight in its entirety is 18 minutes long.</description></item></channel></rss>
